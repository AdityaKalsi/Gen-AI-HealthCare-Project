Overview
<sub>The Gen AI Hackathon project aims to utilize machine learning for healthcare by developing a web application that can detect various diseases such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and stroke. The application provides real-time diagnosis based on predictive modeling. If a disease is detected, the user receives preventive measures and can engage in further conversation with an LLM chatbot specialized in that disease.</sub>

Features
<sub>- Real-time disease detection using machine learning: Instantly analyzes user-provided data to identify potential diseases.

Personalized preventive measures for detected diseases: Offers tailored guidance based on the diagnosed condition.
Interactive LLM chatbot for further consultation: A specialized chatbot provides more information and answers user queries related to the detected diseases.
User authentication with sign-up and sign-in functionality: Secure access for personalized user interactions.
Easy-to-use interface with intuitive navigation: Ensures a smooth user experience with clear and straightforward navigation.</sub>
Step-by-Step Process
<sub>1. User Registration: User signs up or logs in to the platform.
2. Access Diagnosis Page: On the home page, the user navigates to the diagnosis page.
3. Form Filling: The user fills out a form providing necessary information.
4. Disease Prediction: Based on the input, the application predicts whether the user has any of the specified diseases.
5. Preventive Measures: If a disease is detected, personalized preventive measures are provided to the user.
6. Chatbot Interaction: The user can engage in further conversation with a disease-specific LLM chatbot on the chat page.</sub>

Unique Idea Brief
<sub>We have worked on both aspects of the problem statement: Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation.

The Disease Diagnosis part involves identifying the disease based on information provided by the user through form-filling. A machine learning model specific to each disease is used for accurate diagnosis.
The Recommendation Process generates a detailed report that includes causes, symptoms, medical prescriptions, and suggested lifestyle changes.
Additionally, there is an LLM-based chat-doctor, fine-tuned on a specific dataset (link mentioned below), which provides guidance on general medical-related questions.</sub>
